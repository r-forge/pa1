\section*{Introduction}

The \pkg{pa} package provides facilities for conducting performance
attribution for equity portfolios. Three approaches to portfolio
attribution are the Brinson Model, the Regression-based analysis, and
Cross-sectional volatility (CSV) decomposition. This article will
demonstrate how to use the \pkg{pa} package to accomplish these
analyses.

\section*{Background}

To demonstrate the capabilities of the \pkg{pa} package we will
consider a series of examples based on a single real-world data
set. MSCI Barra\footnote{See www.msci.com for details.} is a leaing
provider ofinvestment decision support tools to investment
institutions worldwide. According to the company:

Part of the data used by GEM2 is in the \texttt{GEM2} data frame,
available as part of the \pkg{pa} package. 

<<echo = FALSE, results = hide>>=
options(width = 50, digits = 2, scipen = 5)
library(pa)
@ 


<<>>=
data(GEM2)
names(GEM2)
@ 

\texttt{GEM2} contains selected attributes such as industry, size,
country, and various style factors for a universe of 36,000
securities. The data is on a monthly frequency from January, 2010
through December, 2010. For illustrative purposes, the same 3000
securities are in the data frame each month. 200 of the securities are
randomly selected as holdings in January and are held through December
2010.

Here is a sample of rows and columns from the data frame:

<<echo = FALSE>>=
current.options <- options(digits = 1, width = 80, scipen = 99)
sample.mat <- rbind(GEM2[GEM2$barrid == "USA9J31",][1, ],
                    GEM2[GEM2$date == "2010-02-01",][10,],
                    GEM2[GEM2$barrid == "USA9J31",][3, ],
                    GEM2[GEM2$portfolio > 0,][705, ],
                    GEM2[GEM2$portfolio > 0,][1105, ],
                    GEM2[GEM2$portfolio > 0 & GEM2$return > 0,][500,]
                    )

sample.mat[ , c(1, 3, 4:13, 19, 20)]
@ 

<<echo = FALSE>>=
options(current.options)
@

All portfolio and benchmark holidings are equal-weighted. The row for
Ryanair indicates that, as of July, 2010, it is one of the 200
portfolio holdings with a weight of 0.005. During the month of July,
its return was 4\%. Other columns indicate the style factor scores of
each security.


\section*{The Brinson Model}

The Brinson Model was first presented in the Journal of Portfolio
Management in 1985 and has become the best-known approach to
performance attribution. It separates active returns of any given
portfolio into asset allocation, stock selection, and
interaction. Brinson analysis is run by calling the function
\texttt{brinson} to produce an object of class either \texttt{brinson}
(a single-period portfolio) or \texttt{brinsonMulti} (a multi-period
portfolio).

<<>>=
data(JanGEM2)
br1 <- brinson(JanGEM2, date.var = "date", sector.var = "industry", 
               bench.weight = "benchmark", portfolio.weight = "portfolio", 
               ret.var = "return")
               
@ 

\texttt{JanGEM2} is a data frame containing all the information
necessary to conduct a single-period Brinson
analysis. \texttt{date.var}, \texttt{sector.var}, and \texttt{return}
identify the columns containing the date, sector, and return
variables, respectively. \texttt{bench.weight} and
\texttt{portfolio.weight} specify the portfolio and universe weight of
each security.

Calling \texttt{summary} on the resulting object of class
\texttt{brinson} reports the essential information about the input
portfolio (including number of securities in the portfolio and the
universe and sector exposures) and the results of the Brinson
analysis.

<<>>=
summary(br1)
@ 

The brinson summary shows that the active return of the portfolio,
which consists of 200 randomly selected securities, in January, 2010
was 3.6 basis points (bps). This return can be attributed to 0.6 bps
of allocation effect, -3.0 bps of selection effect, and -1.1 bps of
interaction effect.

\section*{Conclusion}

The \pkg{backtest} package provides a simple collection of tools for
performing portfolio-based tests of financial conjectures.  A much
more complex package, \pkg{portfolioSim}, provides facilities for
historical portfolio performance analysis using more realistic
assumptions.  Built on the framework of the
\pkg{portfolio}\footnote{See \cite{kane:david} for an introduction to
  the \pkg{portfolio} package.} package, \pkg{portfolioSim} tackles
the issues of risk exposures and liquidity constraints, as well as
arbitrary portfolio construction and trading rules.  Above all, the
flexibility of \R{} itself allows users to extend and modify these
packages to suit their own needs.  Before reaching that level of
complexity, however, \pkg{backtest} provides a good starting point for
testing a new conjecture.

\section*{A simple backtest}

Backtests are run by calling the function \texttt{backtest} to
produce an object of class \texttt{backtest}.

<<echo = TRUE>>=
bt <- backtest(starmine, in.var = "smi", ret.var = "ret.0.1.m", by.period = FALSE)
@

\texttt{starmine} is a data frame containing all the information
necessary to conduct the backtest.  \texttt{in.var} and
\texttt{ret.var} identify the columns containing the input and return
variables, respectively. \texttt{backtest} splits observations into 5
(the default) quantiles, or ``buckets,'' based on the value of
\texttt{in.var}.  Lower (higher) buckets contain smaller (larger)
values of \texttt{in.var}.  Each quantile contains an approximately
equal number of observations.  This backtest creates quantiles
according to values in the \texttt{smi} column of \texttt{starmine}.

<<echo=false>>=
table(cut(starmine$smi, breaks = quantile(starmine$smi, probs=seq(0,1,0.20), 
                          na.rm=TRUE, 
                          names=TRUE), 
          include.lowest = TRUE))
@ 

\texttt{backtest} calculates the average return within each bucket.
From these averages we calculate the spread, or the difference between
the average return of the highest and lowest buckets.

Calling \texttt{summary} on the resulting object of class
\texttt{backtest} reports the \texttt{in.var}, \texttt{ret.var}, and
\texttt{by.var} used.  We will use a \texttt{by.var} in later
backtests.

<< echo = TRUE>>=
summary(bt)
@

This backtest is an example of a \emph{pooled} backtest. In such a
backtest, we assume that all observations are exchangeable.  This
means that a quantile may contain observations for any stock and from
any date.  Quantiles may contain multiple observations for the same
stock.

The backtest summary shows that the average return for the highest
bucket was 3.2\%.  This value is the mean one month forward return of
stocks with \texttt{smi} values in the highest quantile.  As the
observations are exchangeable, we use every observation in the
\texttt{starmine} data frame with a non-missing \texttt{smi} value.
This means that the returns for LoJack from both 1995-01-31 and
1995-02-28 would contribute to the 3.2\% mean of the high bucket.

The backtest suggests that StarMine's model predicted performance
reasonably well.  On average, stocks in the highest quantile returned
3.2\% while stocks in the lowest quantile returned 1.1\%.  The spread
of 2.1\% suggests that stocks with high ratings perform better than
stocks with low ratings.

\section*{Natural backtests}

A \emph{natural} backtest requires that the frequency of returns and
observations be the same.  

A natural backtest approximates the following implementation
methodology: in the first period form an equal weighted portfolio with
long positions in the stocks in the highest quantile and short
positions in the stocks in the lowest quantile.  Each stock has an
equal weight in the portfolio; if there are 5 stocks on the long side,
each stock has a weight of 20\%.  Subsequently rebalance the portfolio
every time the \texttt{in.var} values change.  If the observations
have a monthly frequency, the \texttt{in.var} values change monthly
and the portfolio must be rebalanced accordingly.  When the
\texttt{in.var} values change, rebalancing has the effect of exiting
positions that have left the top and bottom quantiles and entering
positions that have entered the top and bottom quantiles.  If the data
contains monthly observations, we will form 12 portfolios per year.

To create a simple natural backtest, we again call \texttt{backtest}
using \texttt{ret.0.1.m}. This is the only return value in
\texttt{starmine} for which we can construct a natural backtest of
\texttt{smi}.

<<natural portfolio>>=
bt <- backtest(starmine, id.var = "id",
               date.var = "date", in.var = "smi",
               ret.var = "ret.0.1.m", natural = TRUE, by.period = FALSE)
@

Natural backtests require a \texttt{date.var} and \texttt{id.var}, the
names of the columns in the data frame containing the dates of the
observations and unique security identifiers, respectively.  Calling
\texttt{summary} displays the results of the backtest:

<<echo=false>>=
current.options <- options()
options(digits = 1, width = 80)
@

\DefineVerbatimEnvironment{Soutput}{Verbatim}{fontsize=\footnotesize}

<<summary natural backtest>>=
summary(bt)
@ 

\DefineVerbatimEnvironment{Soutput}{Verbatim}{fontsize=\small}

<<echo=false>>=
options(current.options)
@

Focus on the mean return of the highest quantile for 1995-02-28 of
1.3\%.  \texttt{backtest} calculated this value by first computing the
5 quantiles of the input variable \code{smi} over all observations in
\code{starmine}.  Among the observations that fall into the highest
quantile, those with date 1995-02-28 contribute to the mean return of
1.3\%.  It is important to note that the input variable quantiles are
computed over the whole dataset, as opposed to within each category
that may be defined by a \code{date.var} or \code{by.var}.

The bottom row of the table contains the mean quantile return over all
dates.  On account of the way we calculate quantile means, a single
stock will have more effect on the quantile mean if during that month
there are fewer stocks in the quantile.  Suppose that during January
there are only 2 stocks in the low quantile.  The return of a single
stock in January will account for $\frac{1}{22}$ of the quantile mean.
This is different than a pooled backtest where every observation
within a quantile has the same weight.  In a natural backtest, the
weight of a single observation depends on the number of observations
for that period.

Calling \texttt{summary} yields information beyond that offered by the
\texttt{summary} method of a pooled backtest.  The first piece of
extra information is average turnover.  Turnover is the percentage of
the portfolio we would have to change each month if we implemented the
backtest as a trading strategy.  For example, covering all the shorts
and shorting new stocks would yield a turnover of 50\% because we
changed half the portfolio.  We trade stocks when they enter or exit
the extreme quantiles due to \texttt{in.var} changes.  On average, we
would turn over 50\% of this portfolio each month.

The second piece of extra information is mean spread.  The spread was
positive each month, so on average the stocks with the highest
\texttt{smi} values outperformed the stocks with the lowest
\texttt{smi} values.  On average, stocks in the highest quantile
outperformed stocks in the lowest quantile by 2\%.  The third piece of
extra information, the standard deviation of spread, is 1\%.  The
spread varied from month to month, ranging from a low of close to 0\%
to a high of over 4\%.

We define the fourth piece of extra information, raw (non-annualized)
Sharpe ratio, as $\frac{\textrm{return}}{\textrm{risk}}$. We set
return equal to mean spread return and use the standard deviation of
spread return as a measure of risk.

\section*{More than one \texttt{in.var}}

\texttt{backtest} allows for more than one \texttt{in.var} to be
tested simultaneously. Besides using \texttt{smi}, we will test market
capitalisation in dollars, \texttt{cap.usd}. This is largely a
nonsense variable since we do not expect large cap stocks to
outperform small cap stocks --- if anything, the reverse is true
historically.

<<echo=false>>=
op <- options(digits = 1)
@ 

<<smi.2 backtest>>=
bt <- backtest(starmine,
                     id.var = "id",
                     date.var = "date",
                     in.var = c("smi", "cap.usd"),
                     ret.var = "ret.0.1.m",
                     natural = TRUE,
                     by.period = FALSE)
@ 

<<echo=false>>=
bt.save <- bt
@ 

Because more than one \texttt{in.var} was specified, only the spread
returns for each \texttt{in.var} are displayed, along with the summary
statistics for each variable.

<<>>=
summary(bt)
@ 
<<echo=false>>=
options(op)
@ 

Viewing the results for the two input variables side-by-side allows us
to compare their performance easily.  As we expected, \texttt{cap.usd}
as an input variable did not perform as well as \texttt{smi} over our
backtest period.  While \texttt{smi} had a positive return during each
month, \texttt{cap.usd} had a negative return in 6 months and a
negative mean spread.  In addition, the spread returns for
\texttt{cap.usd} were twice as volatile as those of \texttt{smi}.

There are several plotting facilities available in \texttt{backtest}
that can help illustrate the difference in performance between these
two signals.  These plots can be made from a natural backtest with any
number of input variables.  Below is a bar chart of the monthly
returns of the two signals together:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\vspace*{.1in}
<<fig=TRUE>>=
plot(bt, type = "return")
@ 
\caption{\label{figure:return}
Monthly return spreads.}
\end{figure}

Returns for \texttt{smi} were consistently positive.  Returns for
\texttt{cap.usd} were of low quality, but improved later in the
period.  \texttt{cap.usd} had a particularly poor return in June. We
can also plot cumulative returns for each input variable:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\vspace*{.1in}
<<fig=TRUE>>=
plot(bt.save, type = "cumreturn.split")
@ 
\caption{\label{figure:fanplot}
Cumulative spread and quantile returns.}
\end{figure}

The top region in this plot shows the cumulative return of each signal
on the same return scale, and displays the total return and worst
drawdown of the entire backtest period.  The bottom region shows the
cumulative return of the individual quantiles over time.  We can see
that \texttt{smi}'s top quantile performed best and lowest quantile
performed worst.  In contrast, \texttt{cap.usd}'s lowest quantile was
its best performing.

Though it is clear from the summary above that \texttt{smi} generated
about 5 times as much turnover as \texttt{cap.usd}, a plot is
available to show the month-by-month turnover of each signal:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\vspace*{.1in}
<<fig=TRUE>>=
plot(bt, type = "turnover")
@ 
\caption{\label{figure:turnover}
Monthly turnover.}
\end{figure}

This chart shows that the turnover of \texttt{smi} was consistently
around 50\% with lower turnover in September and October, while the
turnover of \texttt{cap.usd} was consistently around 10\%.

\section*{Using \texttt{by.var}}

In another type of backtest we can look at quantile spread returns
\emph{by} another variable.  Specifying \texttt{by.var} breaks up
quantile returns into categories defined by the levels of the
\texttt{by.var} column in the input data frame.  Consider a backtest
of \texttt{smi} by \texttt{sector}:

<<echo=false>>=
current.options <- options()
options(digits = 1, width = 50)
@

<<sector backtest>>=
bt <- backtest(starmine, in.var = "smi", ret.var = "ret.0.1.m", by.var = "sector", by.period = FALSE)
@ 

<<echo=FALSE>>=
options(width = 80)
@ 

<<>>=
summary(bt)
@ 

<<echo=false>>=
options(current.options)
@ 

This backtest categorises observations by the quantiles of
\texttt{smi} and the levels of \texttt{sector}.  The highest spread
return of 2.6\% occurs in \texttt{Shops}.  Since \texttt{smi}
quantiles were computed before the observations were split into groups
by \texttt{sector}, however, we can not be sure how much confidence to
place in this result.  There could be very few observations in this
sector or one of the top and bottom quantiles could have a
disproportionate number of observations, thereby making the return
calculation suspect. \texttt{counts} provides a simple check.

<<counts>>=
counts(bt)
@ 

While there seems to be an adequate number of observations in
\texttt{Shops}, it is important to note that there are approximately
60\% more observations contributing to the mean return of the lowest
quantile than to the mean return of the highest quantile, 870 versus
548.  Overall, we should be more confident in results for
\texttt{Manuf} and \texttt{Money} due to their larger sample sizes.
We might want to examine the result for \texttt{HiTec} more closely,
however, since there are more than twice the number of observations in
the highest quantile than the lowest.

\texttt{by.var} can also be numeric, as in this backtest using
\texttt{cap.usd}:

<<echo=false>>=
current.options <- options()
options(digits = 1, width = 30)
@

<<market cap, echo=TRUE>>=
bt <- backtest(starmine, in.var = "smi", ret.var = "ret.0.1.m", by.var = "cap.usd", buckets = c(5, 10), by.period = FALSE)
@ 

<<echo=false>>=
options(current.options)
@

<<>>=
summary(bt)
@ 

Since \texttt{cap.usd} is numeric, the observations are now split by
two sets of quantiles.  Those listed across the top are, as before, the
input variable quantiles of \texttt{smi}.  The row names are the
quantiles of \texttt{cap.usd}.  The \texttt{buckets} parameter of
\texttt{backtest} controls the number of quantiles. The higher returns
in the lower quantiles of \texttt{cap.usd} suggests that \texttt{smi}
performs better in small cap stocks than in large cap stocks.

\section*{Multiple return horizons}

Using \texttt{backtest} we can also analyse the performance of a
signal relative to multiple return horizons.  Below is a backtest that
considers one month and six month forward returns together:

%\DefineVerbatimEnvironment{Soutput}{Verbatim}{fontsize=\scriptsize}
%\DefineVerbatimEnvironment{Sinput}{Verbatim}{fontsize=\footnotesize}

<<echo = TRUE>>=
bt <- backtest(starmine, in.var = "smi", buckets = 4,
               ret.var = c("ret.0.1.m", "ret.0.6.m"), by.period = FALSE)
@ 

<<echo=false>>=
op <- options(width = 80)
@

<<>>=
summary(bt)
@ 


%\DefineVerbatimEnvironment{Sinput}{Verbatim}{fontsize=\small}
%\DefineVerbatimEnvironment{Soutput}{Verbatim}{fontsize=\small}

The performance of \texttt{smi} over these two return horizons tells
us that the power of the signal degrades after the first month.  Using
six month forward return, \texttt{ret.0.6.m}, the spread is 6\%.
This is only 3 times larger than the 2\% spread return in the first
month despite covering a period which is 6 times longer. In other
words, the model produces 2\% spread returns in the first month but
only 4\% in the 5 months which follow.

<<echo=false>>=
options(op)
@
